# Belarus Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict car prices in Belarus using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various car features like brand, model, year, mileage, and fuel type, we build predictive models that help estimate a car's market value.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of multiple regression and machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Deployment-ready scripts

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of used car listings from Belarus, containing features such as:
- **Make & Model**
- **Year of Manufacture**
- **Mileage**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Transmission Type**
- **Price (Target Variable)**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results
The models are evaluated using performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score. The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and generalization ability.
